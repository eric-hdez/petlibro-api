# PetLibro API

Takes inspiration from:
* [PetLibro Integration for Home Assistant](https://github.com/jjjonesjr33/petlibro)
* [PetLibro Homebridge Plugin Integration](https://github.com/praveensharma/HomebridgeLibro)

# Goal of the API

To create a general purpose API for my own custom integrations. The HomeLibro API endpoints and responses have primarily been reversed engineered by people in the pet community who had a need to make integrations for their PetLibro devices.

This library is the beginning of my project to create a live camera feed/interactive feeding experience for friends and family who are fans of my cat Mango.

# Steps

[x] Create a PetLibro API session manager for http calls
[ ] Create a PetLibro API client that performs all API operations I need
